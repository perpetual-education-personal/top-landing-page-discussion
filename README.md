# top-landing-page-discussion

Derek made a video about TOP teaches HTML and CSS. To be fair, most people teach it that way (kinda leaving out the responsive nature of the web browser). [[note: we never put it up on YouTube / but probably should]]

Here's [the video on dev.to](https://dev.to/perpetual_edu/the-odin-project-landing-page-walk-through-214f) and [the video on our blog](https://perpetual.education/stories/odin-landing-page-project-discussion/).

A few people though it was a _rude_ video. - but we think it's pretty rude to teach HTML and CSS like it's _2010_. And as educators, we should be able to deal with critique and suggestions. However - we did learn something intersting. Briggs said that "TOP isn't a "web dev course." Confusing! We always through it was. "The Odin Project: Your Career in Web Development Starts Here
Our full stack curriculum is free and supported by a passionate open source community." Seems like it _is_ saying that it's a web development course. But - hey, maybe it's just an advertizing platform for coding boot camps...

Some code from our video about TOP's landing page project (because a few people asked for it) - BUT really... you should just WRITE THE CODE YOURSELF.
